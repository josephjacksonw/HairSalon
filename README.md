to do:
only add a client if stylists exist
everything else kinda the same
get rid of unneeded css things

cuisines/create might need some Stylist -> stylist

stylists(formerly cuisine) added detail
client(formerly restaurants) removed cost and type and changed rating to visits

models is good, controllers might be good, views needs work

views for clients are good, they need a spot for detail

build readme and database

to do:
only add a client if stylists exist
everything else kinda the same
get rid of unneeded css things

cuisines/create might need some Stylist -> stylist

stylists(formerly cuisine) added detail
client(formerly restaurants) removed cost and type and changed rating to visits
build readme and database
